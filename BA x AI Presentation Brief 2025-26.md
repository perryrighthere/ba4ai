# SUMMATIVE ASSIGNMENT

# BUS13551

# Business Analytics for Artificial Intelligence (B&M)

# Video Recording of the Final Project – 10 minutes (50% final mark)

# General Requirements: Final Project

The key goal of this final project is to assess the application of a specific analytics technique to a real business challenge of your choice. This final project includes two summative assignments:

Video Recording of the Final Project – 10 minutes:  $50\%$  of the overall module mark.  
Executive Summary of the Final Project – 500 words:  $10\%$  of the overall module mark.

For your final project, and for both of these assignments, choose a real business challenge that you have encountered (from previous jobs, projects, modules, etc.).

Frame it as a decision problem and select a fit-for-purpose analytics technique (e.g. clustering, classification, text analytics, simulation).

Some examples are included in the table below.

<table><tr><td>Real Business Challenge</td><td>Specific Analytics Technique</td></tr><tr><td>Market segmentation</td><td>Clustering</td></tr><tr><td>Prediction of customers’ response to an advertisement</td><td>Classification</td></tr><tr><td>Analysis of social media posts</td><td>Text analytics</td></tr><tr><td>Estimation of the appropriate number of employees in a retail store</td><td>Simulation</td></tr></table>

When you choose the real business challenge and the analytics technique, do not feel limited to choosing from the examples above or even from the business challenges and the analytics techniques covered in the module.

Choose your business challenge carefully, as the relevance of the challenge and whether it can be approached via analytics techniques are critical elements that may influence your grade. Please see the marking criteria at the end of this document.

You may not have sufficient information on the real business challenge; assumptions are acceptable if clearly stated and justified. Use public and secondary data sources where possible and cite sources. Report data provenance (source link/name, date accessed, licence), sample size, key features, and basic reproducibility information (e.g., train/test split, optimisation solver/version, or simulation replications).

The executive summary should be thought of as a concise description of your project that will then be expanded in the video recording.

# Specific Guidelines: Video Recording of the Final Project – 10 minutes

The video recording must cover the following points:

1. Description of the real business challenge, with emphasis on the deliverables, key levers and scope, and a clear identification of the assumptions employed.  
2. Application of the specific analytics technique to the real business challenge, with a justification of the analytics technique chosen, a description of the way it was applied to the real business challenge, and a description of the data and parameters used.  
3. Interpretation of the results, with a translation of the results into a business context, and clear recommendations, backed by analysis, to tackle the real business challenge.

As you only have 10 minutes for your recording, it is expected that your presentation should be concise. The examiners are not obliged to grade any content after the 10-minute mark, from the point the video starts playing.

In accordance with the Department's Policy on the Use of Generative AI, this assignment falls under the following category: "Allowed – Students may use GenAI in any way they choose". Include a one-line disclosure clarifying whether you used AI tools, and if you did, which tools and for what purpose. GenAI can sometimes give wrong answers when precise results or statements are required - you remain responsible for correctness.

Referencing can be done on the slide itself or at the end, with all of the references clearly listed.

# SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Your completed assignment must be uploaded to Blackboard no later than 12:00 midday on 15 January 2026

The assignment should be submitting using one of the following file types:

AVI, MP4, MPG, WMV, MOV, QT, ASF, 3GP, WMA, MP3 or M4V

A penalty will be applied for work uploaded after 12:00 midday as detailed here. You must leave sufficient time to fully complete the upload process before the deadline and check that you have received a receipt. At peak periods, it can take up to 30 minutes for a receipt to be generated.

Assignments should be typed, using 1.5 spacing and an easy-to-read 12-point font. Assignments and dissertations/business projects must not exceed the word count indicated in the module handbook/assessment brief.

# The word count should:

- Include all the text, including title, preface, introduction, in-text citations, quotations, footnotes and any other items not specifically excluded below.  
Exclude diagrams, tables (including tables/lists of contents and figures), equations, executive summary/abstract, acknowledgements, declaration, bibliography/list of references and appendices. However, it is not appropriate to use diagrams or tables merely as a way of circumventing the word limit. If a student uses a table or figure as a means of presenting his/her own words, then this is included in the word count.

Examiners will stop reading once the word limit has been reached, and work beyond this point will not be assessed. Checks of word counts will be carried out on submitted work, including any assignments or dissertations/business projects that appear to be clearly over-length. Checks may take place manually and/or with the aid of the word count provided via an electronic submission. Where a student has intentionally misrepresented their word count, the School may treat this as an offence under Section IV of the General Regulations of the University. Extreme cases may be viewed as dishonest practice under Section IV, 5 (a) (x) of the General Regulations.

Very occasionally it may be appropriate to present, in an appendix, material which does not properly belong in the main body of the assessment but which some students

wish to provide for the sake of completeness. Any appendices will not have a role in the assessment - examiners are under no obligation to read appendices and they do not form part of the word count. Material that students wish to be assessed should always be included in the main body of the text.

Guidance on referencing can be found on Durham University website and here.
