# Project Candidates for BA x AI Assignment

Here are three strong project proposals based on your assignment brief. Each option addresses a real business challenge, uses a standard analytics technique, and has high-quality public datasets available.

## Option 1: Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)

**Business Challenge:**
A telecommunications company is losing customers to competitors. Acquiring new customers is 5-10x more expensive than retaining existing ones. The goal is to identify high-risk customers *before* they leave to target them with retention offers.

- **Analytics Technique:** Classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Levers:** Contract type, monthly charges, support calls, payment method.
- **Dataset:** [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Why this works:** Classic business problem with clear financial impact. "Predicting customers' response" is specifically mentioned in your assignment examples.

## Option 2: Employee Attrition Analysis (Classification)

**Business Challenge:**
High employee turnover leads to recruitment costs and loss of institutional knowledge. HR wants to understand *why* employees leave and predict who is at risk to improve retention strategies.

- **Analytics Technique:** Classification (Predicting 'Left' vs 'Stayed').
- **Levers:** Overtime, distance from home, years since last promotion, job satisfaction.
- **Dataset:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Why this works:** Strong business case (reducing turnover costs). The levers are very intuitive for a business presentation.

## Option 3: E-commerce Sentiment & Product Analysis (Text Analytics / Clustering)

**Business Challenge:**
An e-commerce platform needs to understand customer satisfaction drivers to improve product quality and seller performance.

- **Analytics Technique:** Text Analytics (Sentiment Analysis on reviews) OR Clustering (Customer Segmentation).
- **Levers:** Product categories, delivery time, review comments, seller location.
- **Dataset:** [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- **Why this works:** Rich real-world dataset. Allows for "Analysis of social media/reviews" type projects.

## Recommendation

**Option 1 (Churn)** is the safest bet: it's a direct match for the "Classification" example in your brief, and the business value is easiest to explain in 10 minutes.
**Option 2 (HR)** is also excellent if you prefer a non-sales context.
**Option 3 (Olist)** is more complex but potentially more impressive if you want to do Text Analytics.
